# JMail Changelog

## 2.1.0

- Fix bug where addresses containing unquoted Unicode punctuation or symbol characters in the local-part would be incorrectly considered valid.
  - While RFC 6531 allows for UTF-8 characters for the purposes of internationalized domain names, not all Unicode symbols are permitted.
    Specifically, this excludes Punctuation (Pc, Pd, Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf, Po) and Symbols (Sm, Sc, Sk, So).
  - Thanks @acmcmurray for reporting and @houssam966 for contributing! ðŸŽ‰

- Add new `ValidationRule` `disallowDisposableDomains(DisposableDomainSource)` to consider email addresses that have a disposable domain (such as `username@10-minute-mail.com`) as invalid.
  - The `FileSource` implementation of `DisposableDomainSource` uses a given file as the source of truth for disposable domains.
  - The `IsTempMailAPISource` uses the [IsTempMail API](https://www.istempmail.com) as the source of truth for disposable domains. Usage of this source requires an API Key provided by IsTempMail.

---
## 2.0.2

- Fix bug where addresses containing a display name that starts with a dot `.` character would be incorrectly invalidated. (Thanks @utalmighty for reporting!)

---
## 2.0.1

- Fix bug where using the rule `requireTopLevelDomain()` would incorrectly invalidate addresses that use IP domains (since those inherently have a TLD). (Thanks @ahegyes for reporting!)
- Fix bug where addresses starting with an at (`@`) character and ending with either a dot `.` or a colon `:` character threw a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` instead of correctly invalidating the address. (Thanks @alexc-scopely for reporting!)
- Add new `ValidationRule` `disallowSingleCharacterTopLevelDomains()` to consider email addresses with TLDs that are only a single character (such as `test.c`) as invalid. (Thanks @alexc-scopely for suggesting!)

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- By default, `Email#normalized` now lowercases the email address **and** removes any extraneous quotes in
  the local-part of the address. To revert this behavior so that it behaves the same as v1, use the following:
  
  ```
  myEmailObject.normalized(
    NormalizationOptions.builder()
      .keepQuotes()
      .adjustCase(CaseOption.NO_CHANGE)
      .build());
  ```


- The `jmail.normalize.strip.quotes` JVM system property no longer does anything. Quotes are stripped by default now.
  If you need to disable quote stripping, use `NormalizationOptionsBuilder#keepQuotes()`.


- Removed `Email#normalized(boolean)` method which allowed for a normalized email with stripped quotes.
  Quotes are stripped by default now. If you need to disable quote stripping, use `NormalizationOptionsBuilder#keepQuotes()`.


- `FailureReason` was switched from an enum to a class in order to support custom failure reasons, so it is no longer
  possible to use it in a `switch` statement.


- Email addresses that fail validation due to additional rules added to the `EmailValidator` (such as
  `disallowIpDomain()` or `requireValidMXRecord()`) no longer return a generic `FailureReason.FAILED_CUSTOM_VALIDATION`
  in the `EmailValidationResult`. Instead, it returns a more specific `FailureReason` depending on the rule.


- `FailureReason.MISSING_TOP_LEVEL_DOMAIN` was changed to `FailureReason.MISSING_FINAL_DOMAIN_PART`.
  `MISSING_TOP_LEVEL_DOMAIN` was previously used for email addresses that failed validation because
  they ended the email address with a comment. This `FailureReason` was potentially misleading, for example if you
  enabled `requireTopLevelDomain()` on your `EmailValidator`. Note that the `MISSING_TOP_LEVEL_DOMAIN` failure reason
  is now used properly: if you use the rule `requireTopLevelDomain()`, any address that is missing the TLD will give
  that failure reason.


### FailureReason Improvements

#### Changes to the FailureReason supplied for additional rules

The `FailureReason` returned in the `EmailValidationResult` is useful to understand why a specific
email address failed validation. In v2.0.0, the `FailureReason` returned for email addresses that failed
one of the additional validation rules added to your `EmailValidator` (such as `disallowIpDomain()` or
`requireValidMXRecord()`) now return more specific and useful reasons (such as `CONTAINS_IP_DOMAIN` or
`INVALID_MX_RECORD`).

```
EmailValidator validator = JMail.strictValidator()
  .requireOnlyTopLevelDomains(TopLevelDomain.DOT_COM);
  
EmailValidationResult result = validator.validate("test@test.org");

assertEquals(FailureReason.INVALID_TOP_LEVEL_DOMAIN, result.getFailureReason());
```

#### Option to provide FailureReason for custom rules

Additionally, you can specify your own `FailureReason` for any custom validation rules that you add
to your `EmailValidator`. Use the new `withRule(Predicate<Email>, FailureReason)` or
`withRules(Map<Predicate<Email>, FailureReason>)` methods to specify the failure reason for each
of your custom rules. If no failure reason is supplied, then the rule will default to the
`FailureReason.FAILED_CUSTOM_VALIDATION` reason.

```
FailureReason nonGmailFailure = new FailureReason("NON_GMAIL_ADDRESS");

EmailValidator validator = JMail.strictValidator()
  .withRule(e -> e.domain.startsWith("gmail"), nonGmailFailure);
  
EmailValidationResult result = validator.validate("test@yahoo.com");

assertEquals(nonGmailFailure, result.getFailureReason());
```

### Email Address Normalization Improvements

#### New Normalization Methods

This version introduces a new `NormalizationOptions` class that is used to provide
configuration of the behavior of the `Email#normalized()` method. See the table below to see
all the new and existing options.

In v2.0.0, you can use either `Email#normalized()` (with no parameters) or `Email#normalized(NormalizationOptions options)`.

The first method without parameters will return a normalized email address based on the default
normalization options. The second method allows you to provide your own `NormalizationOptions` at runtime
depending on your needs. The custom normalization options can be created using the `NormalizationOptions#builder()`
method.

#### Normalization Options

Thanks, @Sprokof, for contributing (introducing `removeDots` and `adjustCase` options)! ðŸŽ‰

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| stripQuotes                 | Remove all unnecessary quotes in the local-part of the address                                                                                                                                                | `stripQuotes()`                                                                   |
| adjustCase                  | Adjust the case of the email address. Possible options are: `NO_CHANGE`, `LOWERCASE`, `LOWERCASE_LOCAL_PART_ONLY`, `LOWERCASE_DOMAIN_ONLY`, `UPPERCASE`, `UPPERCASE_LOCAL_PART_ONLY`, `UPPERCASE_DOMAIN_ONLY` | `adjustCase(CaseOption)`                                                          |

| performUnicodeNormalization | Perform unicode normalization on the local-part of the email address                                                                                                                                          | `performUnicodeNormalization()` or `performUnicodeNormalization(Normalizer.Form)` |


### Additional Address Formats

Version 2.0.0 introduces new additional email address formats that can be obtained from
the `Email` object (similar to the `normalized()` method).

- `Email#reference()` returns an MD5 hash of the normalized email address.

  ```
    "test@gmail.com" => "1aedb8d9dc4751e229a335e371db8058"
  ```

- `Email#redacted()` returns a version of the normalized email address where the local-part
  is replaced with the SHA-1 hash of the local-part.

  ```
    "test@gmail.com" => "{a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3}@gmail.com"
  ```

- `Email#munged()` returns a version of the normalized email address where the local-part
  and domain are obfuscated with five asterisk characters.

  ```
    "test@gmail.com" => "te*****@gm*****"
  ```


### Support for Leading and Trailing Dots in the Local-Part

While technically disallowed under published RFCs, some email providers (ex: GMail)
consider email addresses that have local-parts that start with or end with a dot `.` character
as valid. For example, GMail considers `.my.email.@gmail.com` valid, even though it is not
actually valid according to RFC.

JMail now gives you the option to consider these addresses valid as well. You must use an
`EmailValidator` with the `allowNonstandardDots` rule added to it to allow these addresses to pass validation.

```java
EmailValidator validator = JMail.strictValidator()
        .allowNonstandardDots();

validator.isValid(".my.email.@gmail.com"); // returns true
```

---
## 1.6.3

- Fix bug where email addresses containing control characters in the local-part were incorrectly considered valid. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for reporting!)
- Add new methods `ifValid(Consumer<Email> action)` and `ifValidOrElse(Consumer<Email> action, Consumer<FailureReason> failureAction)` to the `EmailValidationResult` object.

---
## 1.6.2

- Fix bug where IPv4 addresses with non-arabic numerals would incorrectly be considered valid. (Thanks @harrel56 for reporting!)
- Fix bug where IPv4 addresses with extraneous leading zeros would incorrectly be considered valid. (Thanks @harrel56 for reporting!)
- The `requireValidMXRecord()` validation rule now correctly fails validation for domains that use a "Null MX" record. (Thanks @elmolm for contributing! ðŸŽ‰)

---
## 1.6.1

- Fix bug so that email addresses that end in a dash `-` character now correctly fail validation with the reason `FailureReason.DOMAIN_PART_ENDS_WITH_DASH` instead of incorrectly returning `FailureReason.ENDS_WITH_DOT`. (Thanks @tbatchlear for reporting!)

---
## 1.6.0

- Add a new rule `requireAscii()` that considers an email address containing non-ASCII characters to be invalid. (Thanks @frodeto for suggesting!)
- Add new property `isAscii()` on `Email` objects that returns if the email address only contains ASCII characters or not.
- Add option to strip quotes within the local-part of an email address when normalizing the address with the `normalize()` method. (Thanks @tdelaney-leadiro for suggesting!)
    - This new option will remove quotes if the email address would still be valid and semantically the same without them.
    - To enable the option, either:
        - Call the normalize method that takes a boolean as the parameter, and use `true`. Example: `email.normalize(true)`
        - Set the `-Djmail.normalize.strip.quotes=true` JVM property at runtime, and continue to use the `normalize()` method without parameters.

---
## 1.5.1

- Add a new rule `requireValidMXRecord(int initialTimeout, int numRetries)` that allows for customization of the timeout for DNS lookups. (Thanks @dotneutron for suggesting!)
- Reduce the default timeout for DNS lookups when adding the `requireValidMXRecord()` rule to an `EmailValidator` from potentially taking a maximum of 25 seconds to a maximum of 600 milliseconds.

---
## 1.5.0

- Add new method `validate(String email)` that returns an `EmailValidationResult` object, containing the reason for validation failure upon failure. (Thanks @bobharner for suggesting!)
- Add new `ValidationRule` `requireValidMXRecord()` to consider email addresses that have a domain with no MX record in DNS as invalid. (Thanks @lpellegr for suggesting!)
- Fix bug where an email address that ends with a comment that is missing the closing parentheses were incorrectly considered as valid. For example: `test@test.com(comment`

---
## 1.4.1

- Add new `ValidationRule` `disallowObsoleteWhitespace()` to consider email addresses with obsolete whitespace as invalid. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for suggesting!)

---
## 1.4.0

- Add new `normalized()` method on the `Email` class to provide a way to get a "normalized" version of an email address (the address without any comments or optional parts).

---
## 1.3.3

- Fix bug where invalid characters in the domain could result in an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of returning false. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for reporting!)

---
## 1.3.2

- Fix bug where domain names that contained an emoji would be incorrectly invalid. (Thanks @Autom8edChaos for reporting!)

---
## 1.3.1

- Improve `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for `Email` and `TopLevelDomain`
- Fix inconsistencies in some Javadocs

---
## 1.3.0

- `InternetProtocolAddress.validate(String ip)` now validates IPv6 addresses without requiring the `IPv6:` prefix.
- Add new `JMail.isInvalid(String email)` and `EmailValidator#isInvalid(String email)` methods as a convenience for testing if an email address is invalid.

---
## 1.2.3

- Add `toString()` method on `EmailValidator`
- Add `withRules(Collection<Predicate<Email>> rules)` method on `EmailValidator` to create a new `EmailValidator` from the collection of rules provided

---
## 1.2.2

- Fix bug where an exception would be thrown on invalid email addresses with whitespace or comments after a trailing `.` character. For example, `abc.def@ghi. (comment)` is invalid, and before this version JMail would throw an exception instead of return invalid.
  (Thanks @ea234 for reporting!)

---
## 1.2.1

- `EmailValidator` is now immutable

---
## 1.2.0

- Switch `TopLevelDomain` from an enum to a class, allowing for creation of any valid top level domain (Thanks @bowbahdoe!)
- Add `module-info.java` so projects on JDK 9+ can use this library as a Java module
- Bugfix: Addresses with empty quoted strings (`""@test.org`) are now correctly considered valid
- Bugfix: Addresses with explicit source routing (`@1st.relay,@2nd.relay:user@final.domain`) are now considered valid. However, explicit source routing is deprecated since RFC 5321. `JMail.strictValidator()` disallows explicit source routing by default
- Bugfix: Addresses with quoted identifiers (`John Smith <John@smith.com>`) are now correctly considered valid
- New properties on the `Email` object:
    - `identifier()`
    - `hasIdentifier()`
    - `explicitSourceRoutes()`

---
## 1.1.0

- Disallow construction of utility classes and prevent classes from being subclassed (Thanks @bowbahdoe!)
- Fix bug where email addresses that have a dotless domain or top level domain starting with the `-` character would be incorrectly classified as valid.
  For example, `test@-foo` and `test@my.-domain` should both be invalid.

---
## 1.0.4

- You can now disallow email addresses with reserved domains listed in [RFC 2606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606), such as `example.com` or `.invalid`.

   ```
   JMail.validator().disallowReservedDomains().isValid("test@example.com");
   ```
  
---
## 1.0.3

- Fix bug where JMail did not consider single quoted symbols (ex. `\@`) as valid.

---
## 1.0.2

- Better javadocs
- Internal performance improvements

---
## 1.0.1

- Add `JMail.strictValidator()` that has pre-configured common rules enabled (stricter than the RFCs allow)

---
## 1.0.0

- Initial release of JMail with email validation, IP address validation, and custom rules.
